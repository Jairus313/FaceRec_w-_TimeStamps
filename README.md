# FaceRec_w-_TimeStamps
A Deep Learning Project for Face Recognition with Timestamps

Here I have used CNN model with VGG16 architecture for training the model. Used HaarCascade for extracting faces from video.

After recognisation of particular faces a simple timestamps are collected from system's time and later saved it .csv file format where the identity of the person and time is saved.
